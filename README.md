Computoser
==========

An algorithm for music composition. Results can be seen at http://computoser.com

The code of the algorithm is in the main package (com.music), the rest of the packages contain the model and the classes required for the website computoser.com. 

In order to run the algorithm simply run the main method of the Generator class, or build the project with maven and deploy the war file (with the path to the properties file configured using -Dmusic.config.location=...)

The paper describing the algorithm in details is available <a href="https://www.academia.edu/9696759/Computoser_-_rule-based_probability-driven_algorithmic_music_composition">here</a> and <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.3079">here</a>
